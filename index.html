       Thousand Knives (1978), and later released the album B-2 Unit (1980), from which "Riot in Lagos" influenced 
       the development of electro and hip hop music. He went on to produce more solo records, collaborate with many 
       international artists, and pursue a wide variety of projects, in different genres ranging from electronic to 
       classical and world music. He composed music for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics opening ceremony, and his composition "Energy Flow" (1999)
       was the first instrumental number-one single in Japan's Oricon charts history.He has collaborated with a range of artists, 
       including David Sylvian, Carsten Nicolai, Youssou N'Dour, and Fennesz.

       and four Golden Globe nominations. Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983) marked his debut as a film score composer and as an actor, and its main 
       theme was adapted into the single "Forbidden Colours" which became an international hit. His most successful work as a film composer was The Last
       Emperor (1987), after which he continued earning accolades composing for films such as The Sheltering Sky (1990), Little Buddha (1993), and 
       The Revenant (2015). On occasion, Sakamoto has also worked on anime and video games, as a composer as well as a scenario writer. In 2009, he was
